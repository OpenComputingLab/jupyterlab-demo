JupyterLab provides an \"IDE\" (integrated development environment) style environment, rather than the document centric classic notebook environment. A document centric notebook UI, originally called \"RetroLab\", built from the JupyterLab framework components will be used as the official Jupyter notebook release from version 7. The original notebook user interface, typically referred to as the \"classic\" notebook, will be deprecated from official releases and enter a \"maintenance only\" phase. This means that future improvements to things like accessibility are unlikely to happen unless new community memgers step in to take up the effort.\n\nRisks associated with *not* migrating away from the deprecated classic notebook environment include: being locked in to outdated, legacy software with little of no community maintenance or support; lack of development and adoption of new features that become commonpalce elsewhere; lack of general currency for users in terms of the use of tools and adoption of corresponding work practices that are to be expected in contemporary development environments.\n\nBased on evidence to date, it is not clear from where, if anywhere, such effort might come, despite the large installed user base, particulalry in the education sector.\n\nMy fear is that a commercial educational publisher or learning environment vendor might step in with a promise of maintaining support for institutions wishing to stick with the classic notebook UI, whilst at he same time then locking them in to proprietary features, standards and conventions that are not portable across the wider Jupyter and open source communities.

      "source": "## Issues Associated With Migrating From Classic Notebook to an Alternative User Environment\n\nIssues associated with migrating to a new user environment may be viewed in terms potential benefits versus potential costs.\n\nIn terms of costs, there is a large ecosystem of community as well as independently produced extensions for the classic notebook environment that will not work in the JupyerLab environment. Similarly, there is a large and growing number of JupyterLab framework extensions that will not work in the classic notebook context.\n\nBenefits are those that arise naturally from joing an actively developed project with a growing community and user base. There is also an opportunity to take stock of what we have learned thus far and reflect on what sort of environment might best support teaching and learning across a programme of study (over which we might expect skills to develop from novice level to more expert users). More generally, we might also consider the extent to which a teaching and learning environment might also help develop awareness of, expectations around, and skills associated with, tools of the professional computational trade.\n\nIn practical terms, other than simple institutional inertia, what have been some of the blockers, in the OU, real or imagined, to moving away from the currently used classic Jupyter notebooks to alternative environments. In TM351, notebook pedagogy has evolved over the last five or so years of presentation in three main ways:\n\n- revision and updating of how notebooks are constructed as written teaching and learning material (chunk size, blend of text and code activities);\n- revision and updating of the notebook environment (use of colour styles to signpost expected student activity, development of interactive tools to encourage playful exploration an self-directed, self-assessing student activities);\n- revision and updating of assessment strategies.\n\nThe second item is the one that throws up the most tangible blockers to migration. For example, several custom notebook extensions, as well as third party extensions, are used to customise the notebook environment in visual as well as functional terms. For the coloured cell background styling, there are essentially two components: notebook cell metadata, and a custom extension to render notebooks according to cell meadata. To render notebooks with corresponding styling in a new environment will require a custom renderer capable of rendering notebooks according to the metadata. Many *IPython* extensions that generate customised cell outputs are essentially agnostic as to whether classic or JupyterLab environments are being used and often work equally with *any* IPython environment (IPython is often the default code execution environment used by Jupyter noebooks, although a wide variety of other programming languages are supported too).\n\nOne of the issues associated with migrating to JuptyerLab framework environments is that the development process for building JupyterLab extensions is considerably more involved than devleoping notebook extensions for classic notebook. Classic notebook extensions were often relatively simple HTML, Javascript and CSS bundles requiring no real developer tooling. By contrast, JupyterLab extensions requires a large toolchain to build typescript and node.js applications against a large and complex JupyterLab API that can be hard to navigate and that suffers from a lack of good examples and well documented tutorials.\n\nIn part because of the difference in the richness of the JupyerLab IDE style environment versus the document centric RetroLab/Notebook v.7 environment, many JupyterLab extensions may only be meaningful in a JupyterLab context, whereas RetroLab/Notebook v.7 extensions directed at the notebook application are likely to work equally well in the Notebook v.7 and JupyterLab notebook contexts (that is, notebooks opened within JupyterLab).\n\nCosts of mogration are also associated with updating notebooks so that they make most effective usee of any *new* environment (which we might also think of, in part at least, as a new *medium*). Ideally, where notebook metadata was used for customisation in classic notebooks, the same metadata should be treated in a similar way by custom renderers in an new environment, which means the cost should be limited to creating new extensions. However, in migrating to some some environments, it may be that notebooks need pre-processing before customisations can be applied to them.\n\nFinally, there may be different forms of user cost associated with changing the environment that must be borne by students and ALs, as end users of the environment, as well module teeams.\n\nFor example, we might consider costs associated with changed environments for:\n\n- module teams involved with development and maintenance of both teaching and learning materials as well as support materials;\n- module teams and support staff involved with development, maintenance and testing of the production and maintenance environments, as well as the end-user environment;\n- ALs working on the same module over many presentations, who may have developed materials tuned to the earlier environment;\n- students meeting different environments as they progress through several modules and having to learn new skills and habits as well as perhaps having to forget previous, no longer relevant, ones.",

      "source": "## Migration Away From Classic Notebook\n\nThere are two UIs supported by the Jupyter community:\n\n- Jupyter notebook v7, previously known as `RetroLab`;\n- JupyterLab.\n\nThere are also other enviromments that work with the Jupyter notebook document format (traditionlly, `.ipynb` JSON formatted documents, but more recently various text based formats  such as [`MyST` (Markedly Structured Text)](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) are gaining popularity, supported by tools such as Jupytext and Quarto, as well as initiatives such as the *Executable Book Project*). For example, notebooks can be edited using the VS Code and PyCharm IDEs, and can be used in WYSIWYG publishing environments such as Curvenote. There are also a large number of environment that run Jupyter servers and editing environments as off-the-shelf tools in only very lightly customised environments (most customisation comes in the form of integration wih data sources, or the provision of high performance compute nodes, GPUs, etc.).\n\n__Classic notebook UI__\n![](images/classic_nb.png)\n\nCurrently, the three environments that arguably provide the best alternative to classic Jupyter notebook are:\n\n- Jupyter Notebook v7 (originally, `RetroLab`), a document centric notebook environment resembling classic notebook;\n\n__Notebook v7/Retrolab UI__\n![](images/retrolab_ui.png)\n\n- JupyterLab, a \"data science IDE\" that combines an IDE aesthetic with embdedded \"applications\" often generated from or within notebooks;\n\n__JupyterLab UI__\n![](images/jupyterlab_ui.png)\n\n- VS Code with Python and Jupyter extensions enabled, offering the ability to edit Jupyter notebooks and connect to Jupyter kernels from with this popular devleoper IDE.\n\nIn terms of the Jupyter community supported enviroments, the JupyterLab UI has more of an IDE-like feel, whereas Jupyter notebook v7. aims to provide a document centric environment more akin to the classic notebook. I am starting to warm to JupyterLab as a teaching and learning environment in the sense that it provides a single locus for a wide range of tools that can be used to support a student as they work through provided materials. For document centric authoring, the notebook UI still offers a \"technical literate programming\" style environment suited to annotated computational exploration, with enviroments such as Curvenote tending more towards \"authoring of computational documents\" style of activity.\n\nIn this document, I will describe one possible configuration of JupyterLab configured environment that makes uses of a selection of pre-installed extensions to provide an integrated computational teaching and learning environment.\n\nThe extensions will support the following:\n\n- OU (TM129 & TM351) flavoured notebooks:\n  - OU branded notebooks;\n  - thematic coloured cells (activity cells, call to action cells, tutor feedback / warning cells);\n  - dynamically highlighted cell status.\n\n- enriched display:\n  - automatic table of contents for selected document;\n  - native styled text boxes created using MyST flavoured admonition blocks;\n  - text generated diagrams.\n\n- improved file management\n  - open files in local filesystem:\n    - provides a way for students to work against files on their local computer (currently requires Chrome browser);\n    - for local VCE, this means we don't necessarily need to mount a shared directory for notebook files and assets;\n  - manage files using git and Github:\n    - introduces students to version control in a natural way;\n    - provides a way for students to manually synch files over multiple devices and environments.\n\n- integrated applications:\n  - spreadsheet editor;\n  - drawio drawing package.\n\n- launcher buttons:\n  - OpenRefine;\n  - nbSearch.\n\n- possible collaborative features:\n  - chat / video chat / screen share via Jitsi (not tested);\n  - a collaborative mode does exist for Jupyter notebooks but I haven't got this working yet.",

      "source": "## An Exciting Possibility — \"Serverless\" Delivery of Jupyter Environments Using JupyterLite\n\nMany of these extensions can be installed in an in-browser `JuptyerLite` environment. `JupyerLite` is a Jupyter distribution built on top of the Pyodide WASM environment. This runs __entirely within the browser__ and only requires a webserver to publish the environment. Edited files persist in browser storage. Alternatively, files can be opened from a directory in the local desktop file system, edited and executed in the browser environment, and saved back to the desktop.\n\nA JupyerLite style environment may be appropriate for many modules that only require Python packages supported by [pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/). *Note that this includes a large number of Python packages on PyPi that publish an O/S agnostic `-py3-none-any.whl` flavoured wheel.*\n\nSome modules, such as TM351, which rely on computing environments that provide a range of other services, such as databases, or Java powered applications such as OpenRefine, cannot be supported solely by the standalone JupyterLite environment. However, it may be possible to deliver other modules wholly within a JupyterLite environment. Work is currently in -progess to explore the extent to which core (non-optional) practical elements of the TM129 Robotics block may be delivered purely within a JupyterLite environment.\n\nBeing able to deliver environments solely through the browser with only a web server required to deliver the environment has resource implications for both students and the OU. For students, downloading the browser environment may require a download of several hundred megabytes each time the environment is downloaded. (However, the application will remain resident and viable in an open browser tab for an extended period of time.) Computation performed by the environment is also at the students expense, although this may be regarded as negligible.\n\nIn terms of financial costs, if the environments and their dependencies are downloaded from OU webservers, the bandwidth requirements on the OU may be significant. However, many of the packages are available via CDNs, which means the costs are implicitly transferred to them. If the OU were to heavily promote the use of JupyterLite, we should contribute developer effort to improving the \"offline\" performance of JupyterLite in terms of improved cacheing and enabling \"browser webapp\" style support. (This would probably not require a significant allocation of effort, but would improve resource utilisation at a global scale.)\n\nWhen providing hosted computational environments, the per module presentation cost can run into thousands of pounds.  The costs to the OU of providing students with hosted computational environments can be dramatically reduced by students using their own environments. Currently, students can run equivalent local environments the hosted environments using Docker containers. This requires installation by the student of the Docker application and a one time bandwidth cost of up to several gigabytes to download the Docker image. Images are currently downloaded from public third party repositories. Consequently, the hosting and bandwidth cost associated with downloading images are not currently borne by the OU.",

Diagram types include flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, Gantt charts and other diagram types.\n\n\nFor example, the following MyST styled admonition block:\n\n`````\n```{warning}\nThis is a warning block.\n```\n`````\n\nwill be rendered as:\n\n![](images/warning_admonition.png)\n\nOther blocks include `danger` (red header bar), `note` (blue), `seealso` (lilac), `important` (light grey-green) and `tip` (light green). The header bars also carry distinguishing leading icons. Using the `{admonition} My Title` style block, a title can be added to the block and the can be styled using the appropriate admonition type set as a `:class:` value. For example:\n\n`````\n```{admonition} Take this as a warning!\n:class: warning\n\nThis is a warning block.\n```\n`````\n\n![](images/warning_admonition_title.png)\n\nThe MyST syntax also supports various other rich presentation features, such as panels and tabs, rendering support for which may also become available in JupyterLab notebok editors.\n\nThe diagramming support bundled with the `jupyterlab-markup` extension allows mermaid code can be included directly in a markdown cell:\n\n`````\n```mermaid\n\ngraph LR;\n    A-->B;\n    A-->C;\n    B-->D;\n    C-->D;\n    D-->E;\n```\n`````\n\nThe rendered cell then displays the corresponding mermaid rendered image:\n\n![](images/mermaid_diag.png)\n\nBeing able to *write* diagrams that are then automatically rendered provides an accessible, text-based way for creating (and editing) diagrams. It removes the need for graphical image editors and can simplify the process of diagram creation.

For a user working within the same JupyterLab environment on a range of tasks, different user workspaces can be used to persist a different lab layout for each task. For exampe, a student could maintain one workspace as they work through teaching materials, one for a current TMA, and one for work-in-progress towards the EMA.\n\nCurrently, workspaces are essentially managed manually: in JupyterLab, change the URL path `/lab/` to `/lab/workspaces/myworkspace` to enter the workspace `myworkspace`. Save the current configuration / layout of the workspace from the *File* menu.",

      "source": "## Collaborative Working  Support\n\nA wide variety of online applications now offer real time collaborative support ([JupyterLab — Real Time Collaboration](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/rtc.html)). Migrating to JuptyerLab or Jupyer Notebook v7/RetroLab offers the possibility of \"collaborative notebooks\", where multiple users, such as collaborating students in a group project, or a tutor and a student, work on the same notebook.\n\nEach user is represented in their own view of the document with a named cursor, and updates made to the document by either party are visible in the copy of the other party. This feature is still in its early stages, with various usability issues still to contend with (such as if two people collaborate on a document, then make separate, independent changes to their copy of the document, then collaborate again. But for one user interceding in a \"primary owner's\" copy of a document, it can be be quite effective.\n\nThe mechanism for real-time collabration between users is slightly different in JupyerLite vs. served environments. The following example is from the JupyterLite environment:\n\n![](images/jupyterlite_collab.png)",

(Activity in the shared spaces is not recorded; however, sever logs may be able to demonstrate whether two or more identifable users have accessed the same shared space at the same or different times.)\n\nNote that students running locally served environments will not be able to use those for collaborative working unless they are configured as collaborative serviers and exposed to the public internet. This is probably a step too far in terms of risk management.",
