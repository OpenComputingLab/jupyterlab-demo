To get the file into the local file system, you need to *download* it (`File > Download`). *Note that the downloaded file is the __saved__ version of the file, so save your notebook before downloading it.* Close the notebook in JupyterLite, and then ensure that the downloaded copy is placed into the appropriate local file system directory. Reopen the notebook from the local file system file listing in JupyterLite. Any updates made to the notebook and then saved will now also be saved back to the local file system.\n\nThe directory path the upload file file picker opens at may be different to the directory path used in selecting the directory on the desktop filesystem.",
